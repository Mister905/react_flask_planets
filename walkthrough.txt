* Initialize front end / back end directories

npx create-react-app client

mkdir api

* Create and Activate Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

* Deactivate Virtual Environment

deactivate

* Install python modules

pip install flask python-dotenv

* Initialize Flask app

touch api.py

* Flask imports the application from the place indicated by the FLASK_APP environment variable. 
To avoid having to manually set this variable every time, create e a .flaskenv file, which Flask automatically 
imports into the environment on startup if it finds the python-dotenv package installed.

touch .flaskenv

* At this point this basic Flask project is complete. To make sure that it is working well you can start it

flask run

* React Proxy Configuration

* The React project can be configured to redirect any requests it receives on its port 3000 that it does not understand into another server. 
* This is configured simply by adding a proxy key at the bottom package.json:

/client/package.json

"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"

"start_api": "cd ../api && venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger",

* Adding the Flask Project to Git

touch .gitignore

touch api/.gitignore

git init

git remote add origin git@github.com:Mister905/react_flask_planets.git

git add .

git commit -m "Inialized project"

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

* Running the Combined Project

cd client

* Start Front End

yarn start

* Start Back End

* Install React-Router

~/react_flask_planets/client
yarn add react-router-dom

* pip freeze and install

* You can freeze requirements on one machine and then later on a different machine or on a clean environment 
* You'll get the an identical environment with the exact same dependencies installed as you had in the original 
* environment where you generated the frozen-requirements.txt

pip freeze > frozen-requirements.txt

pip install -r frozen-requirements.txt
